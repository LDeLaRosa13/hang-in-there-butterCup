# Hang in There  

### Abstract:
 We built a web application that generates random inspirational posters with different images, titles, and quotes as well as gives the user the opportunity to create their own, unique poster. This application also allows the user to store their current favorite posters in a seperate tab and delete them whenever they need. The features included are:

- the ability to generate a new random poster each time the page loads
- the ability to switch between multiple tabs for a different view of the application
- the ability to make custom posters by using the users input
- the ability to save a random or custom made poster
- the ability to delete any previously saved posters
- This application gives the user a space to create and store inspirational posters. They can also browse a random selection of pre-existing inspirational posters.

### Learning Goals:
- Write clean, DRY JavaScript
- Build out functionality using functions that show trends toward SRP
- Manipulate the page after it has loaded adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM
- Explore the connection between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Practice reading, understanding, and using provided code
- Write code collaboratively
- Document changes with atomic commits and thorough code reviews
- Communicate, troubleshoot, and plan effectively as a team
- Ensure that all [both] team members are able to be heard and contribute throughout the project Tech involved includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

### Wins + Challenges:
Wins: Even with little pre-existing knowledge of the methods to be used, being able to formulate our questions effectively on google.

We each brought our own strengths to the project and were able to effectively learn from each other while being exposed to new ideas, techniques, and perspectives.

Troubleshooting with precision by using console.log in the right places. Pseudocoding steps.

Challenges: When we encountered a particularly difficult problem while writing code, we were able to overcome it through persistence and problem-solving as a team.

Even though the project had tasks that we hadnâ€™t encountered before, we broke down the assignment into small chunks of manageable problems.
